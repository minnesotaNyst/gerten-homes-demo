# Welcome to Gerten Homes

## Description

Gerten Homes has requested a web app that provides end user a dynamic web experience, and drives website interaction and lead generations.

The application contains experiences based on user authentication, and allows the real estate organization the ability to share additional content with users (once logged in), generate leads through a contact form, store all data in a database, and tracks web interactions using the Google Analytics platform.
